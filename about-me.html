<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Boy, this microphone smells like beer. Well, let's just say AA was "A" waste of time. Capoeira is the most seductive form of self-defence. It combines peacefulness, fighting, and cardio in perfect harmony. Capoeira is breathtaking, but it is also breath-giving. All right, so, uh... you'll need an adult to supervise you. We know an adult. We definitely know an adult. Well, I had a crazy dream that there wouldn't be a cow's a-s-s in my face when I'm eating my breakfast. I know what that spells. Talk to me, Goose. I'm not wearing anything under my snowsuit. Oh, my God! Except for my long underwear. And my socks. And my other socks. And a maxi pad. Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self-esteem over a period of years.</p>
